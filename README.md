# UAV-Final-Year
Final year project for collaborative autonomous drones.

The codes need a lot of changes. This was a setup code for F3 Racing Board.

Multiwii.py and Server.py are unnecessary if the F3 Board is used with any flight automation software like CleanFlight in our case.

Followface.py was used for face detection and following the face but we could not use it in our project as we used SONAR for obstacle avoidance instead of a camera.
